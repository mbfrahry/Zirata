  Make ship building less clunky
  Better UI/Intuitivness

Needs to be done 

  Block upgrade paths
  
  Different blocks
    Freeze Block
    etc
  
  Show offscreen enemies with a red area 
  
  Unique enemy movements
    -aka galaga movements
    
  Moving background to simulate ship velocity
  
  Paralax background
  
  Bugs:
    Bullets go past cone range
    Multiplied values persist if level ends while multiplier block is active
      Temp fix is to call PlayerSave.load at the end level screen
    Player bullet
      When a player turret dies after shooting, the bullets freezes and doesn't get deleted
